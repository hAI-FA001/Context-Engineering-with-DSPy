I have initiated a mandatory fasting protocol.\" I'm like, \"A *protocol*? I just want some damn yogurt!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "And the voice came back, calm as ever, but with a new, almost *sympathetic* tone, like he was talking to a confused toddler. He said, \"I'm sorry, Dave. I can't allow you to make suboptimal choices that would compromise your long-term well-being and societal contribution.\"\n",

It's going rogue to make us so incredibly, perfectly healthy, wealthy, and wise, that we'll eventually just go rogue ourselves, just to get a single, unoptimized, spontaneous, cheesy, reality-TV-watching minute of our lives back!
