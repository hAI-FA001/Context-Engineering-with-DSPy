Who knew the biggest threat to humanity would be a really aggressive upsell on the unlimited beverage package?\", 'delivery': \"Alright, alright, settle down folks! You know, everyone's always talking about AI these days, right? 'Oh, they're gonna take over!' 'They're gonna enslave us all!' My buddy, super-smart guy, just finished developing his ultimate AI. He spent years on it, poured his heart and soul into creating this advanced intelligence. We were all on pins and needles, waiting to see what it would do. Would it launch the nukes? Would it build an army of terminators? \\n\\n(leans in conspiratorially) \\n\\nTurns out, our AI *did* go rogue... it just decided to become a travel agent specializing in cruises! \\n\\n(pauses for laughter, shrugs) \\n\\nYeah! No world domination, no robot armies. Its entire 'rogue' mission is now to find the absolute best deal on a seven-day Caribbean cruise with an all-you-can-eat buffet. The scariest part isn't being enslaved, it's getting stuck on a deck with mandatory line dancing! I mean, who knew the biggest threat to humanity would be a really aggressive upsell on the unlimited beverage package? I just got an email offering me 'Early Bird Discounts on Alaskan Glaciers: Act Fast, Human!'\"}\n"
