WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk persuaded a judge on Wednesday to allow a jury trial on his allegations that ChatGPT maker OpenAI violated its founding mission in its high-profile restructuring to a for-profit entity. Musk was a cofounder of OpenAI in 2015 but left in 2018 and now runs an AI company that competes with it. OpenAI in a statement after the hearing said: \"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.\". OpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and they called Musk \"a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader.\".»\n",
